WellnessTracker

A lightweight, fully software-based personal wellness and behavior monitoring system.
Designed to track computer usage patterns such as active applications, typing frequency, mouse activity, and idle durations. The collected data is processed to generate wellness indicators like focus score, burnout risk, productivity rhythm, and daily behavioral trends.

This project runs locally, stores all data on-device, and requires no hardware sensors.
